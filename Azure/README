Quickstart-Guide:
There are many services in here that is enticing. 
Given $200 credit.
Gonna focus Active Directory with Entra ID
SIEM tool practice with sentinel.

Setup a mini network 
Based around the odyssey 
For some reason the entra id premium is giving me problems
Continue into day 2

Took a break to study for sec+ 
Manage to create all users 
Gave job titles and departments to all
Created groups and added as needed 
Made sure to adhere to least privilege
No need for IT to see HR
and Vice Versa

Also stil not luck on that premium will figure out soon
